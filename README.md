## WTA Tennis Rankings, Results, and Stats

For now, this contains my master WTA player file, plus historical rankings.

The player file columns are: player_id, first_name, last_name, hand, birth_date, country_code.

The columns for the ranking files are: ranking_date, ranking, player_id, ranking_points, tours. 'Tours' is WTA jargon for certain types of tournaments played, and that column is not anywhere near complete.

Rankings are through the end of 2014.

Update, 21/3/15

My WTA match result database is now here, as well. These files (e.g. 'wta_matches_2014.csv') contain all tour-level singles matches for that season. To make them easier to use, I've included a fair bit of redundancy with the biographical and ranking files: each row contains several columns of biographical information, along with ranking and ranking points, for both players. Ranking data, as well as age, are as of tourney_date, which is almost always the Monday at or near the beginning of the event.

Update, 24/3/15

I've added one additional match results file per year, which comprises all tour-level qualifying matches and all main-draw ITF matches.

Update, 8/4/15

2015 rankings and results are now available through last week's play. The results files are named according to the same conventions as the others. The rankings file for the current year is wta_rankings_current.csv.
